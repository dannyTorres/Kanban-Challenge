## Kanban Challenge

Create a basic **Kanban** board, use **Redux** to store the state of the application.

Requeriments:
  - Need to have three columns (Todo, In-Progress, Done).
  - Task should have a title and a small description.
  - Add an "Add Task" at the top of the board, then open a modal with a title and description field and a submit button.
  - Task can be move across the columns (drag & drop not required- use buttons or the approach you prefer).

**Feel free to add any feature/approach to enrich your solution.**

**Good Luck :)**
